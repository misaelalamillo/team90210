"As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles"
The read me was basically my pseudo code, thankfully I had my first session with the tutor today and she basically said the read me is 
self explanatory, to not think too hard about it. Whenever it says return for the contructors it really means to put an actual return.
For the constructor for manager, engineer, employee and intern the readme gives you the answers on how to make it.
What relly helped out for the homework was the mini project in folder 24, it shows you how the contructors work.
In this case I knew Employee was going to be the one to carry the name, id, and email.
Once I had my contructors done I followed over to the app.js file to work on the inquirer.
What truly helped for this part was the mini project in folder 40.
Created two arrays, then went ahead and made the inquirer. Asked the general questions and then created else if for manager, engineer and intern.
